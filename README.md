Photo Renamer
=============

Photo Renamer was created to give proper names to files coming out of
digital cameras. There are multiple tools (such as Adobe Lightroom) that can
(more) intelligently rename files based on more criteria, but the main feature
I found lacking was time manipulation. I often forget to change the time
on my camera when traveling and want to use the time a picture was taken
as part of the filename. Photo Renamer will allow you to, for example,
add or subtract hours to compensate for different time zones.

This app is a simple hack, but I find it useful for my needs.
The code could use cleanup and refactoring.
